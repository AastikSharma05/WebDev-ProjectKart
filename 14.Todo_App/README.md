I have added a Todo App which can be used to substitute the existing Todo App Project owing to its more options and interactivity.

This ToDo List allows the user to create any number of todo lists as per their preference. Let's say for eg: Separate todo lists for House, Work, Entertainment.

All that the user has to do is to add the name of the new todolist at the end of home route.
Like : https://todo-list-projectkart.herokuapp.com/Work or https://todo-list-projectkart.herokuapp.com/Office
If he already has an existing todo list with that name, that todo list will be opened up, otherwise a new todo list will be created with the provided name.

The home route opens up today's todo list by default : https://todo-list-projectkart.herokuapp.com/

Also, whenever any list becomes empty after removing all items, the instructions are shown on the todo list for new users.
Removing an item is more user interactive since on clicking the checkbox next to the finished item, it is first struck off and then removed.
